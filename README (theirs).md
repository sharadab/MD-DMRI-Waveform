# Numerical optimization of gradient waveforms (NOW) for tensor-valued dMRI
A MATLAB package for optimization of gradient waveforms that yield b-tensors of arbitrary shape that can be tailored to pulse sequence timing and hardware restrictions.  

The optimizer supports the following:
* Arbitrary b-tensor shape
* Variable raster resolution
* Asymmetric sequence timing
* Control for 0th-moment balance
* Control for energy consumption/heating
* L2 and max-norm amplitude constraints
* Nulling of concomitant gradient effects
* Nulling of motion encoding

## Getting started
First, download (clone or fork) this repository and open it in MATLAB. You can generate waveforms in a graphical interface by calling `NOW_GUI.m`. To access all optimization controls, you can run the optimization via a script. An example script is provided in `scripted_NOW_example.m`.  

Setting up the optimizer always follows these steps:
1. Create object that specifies optimization problem by calling `pObj = optimizationProblem()`
2. Modify `pObj` to your specification
3. Update the derived parameters of `pObj` by feeding it through the function `pObj = optimizationProblem(pObj)`
4. Call the optimizer run function using `pObj` as input, according to `[result, pObj] = NOW_RUN(pObj)`

The `result` structure contains several fields; among them is the gradient waveform. Notably, the fields `gwf`, `rf` and `dt`, are compatible with the [multidimensional diffusion (md-dMRI) framework](https://github.com/markus-nilsson/md-dmri) format. With the md-dMRI framework installed, an overview of the resulting gradient waveform can be plotted by calling `gwf_plot_all(result.gwf, result.rf, result.dt)`.

## Review paper on gradient waveform design
Gradient waveforms can be intended for many kinds of purposes and deployed on vastly different hardware. The general design of gradient waveforms for dMRI, with special focus on tensor-valued encoding, has been described in:
* General gradient waveform design by Szczepankiewicz et al. (2021):

## Free waveform encoding pulse sequence
To run user-defined gradient waveforms a special MRI pulse sequence is usually required. Pulse sequences are available for multiple vendors and scanner software versions. Please refer to the [free waveform (FWF) encoding resource site](https://github.com/filip-szczepankiewicz/fwf_seq_resources) for more information.
