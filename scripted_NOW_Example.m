%    Max gradient = 80 milliTesla/m
%    Max slew rate = 100 milliTesla/m/milliSecond = 100 T/m/s

%%  PREP
% First, set up the optimization problem. Do this first to create a
% structure where fields are pre-specified. Note that some fields are
% read-only and that new fields cannot be created.
problem = optimizationProblem;

% Define the hardware specifications of the gradient system
problem.gMax =  80; % Maximal gradient amplitude, in [mT/m]
problem.sMax = 100; % Maximal gradient slew (per axis), in [T/(sm)]

% Request encoding and pause times based on sequence timing in [ms]
problem.durationFirstPartRequested    = 32;
problem.durationSecondPartRequested   = 27;
problem.durationZeroGradientRequested = 8;

% Define the b-tensor shape in arbitrary units. This example uses an
% isotropic b-tensor that results in spherical tensor encoding (STE).
problem.targetTensor = eye(3);

% Define the number of sample points in time. More points take longer to
% optimize but provide a smoother waveform that can have steeper slopes.
problem.N = 50;

% Set the balance between energy consumption and efficacy
problem.eta = 0.9; %In interval (0,1]

% Set the threshold for concomitant gradients (Maxwell terms). 
% Please see https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.27828 for more information on how 
% to set this parameter.
problem.MaxwellIndex = 100; %In units of (mT/m)^2 ms

% Set the desired orders of motion compensation and corresponding
% thresholds for allowed deviations. See Szczepankiewicz et al., MRM, 2020
% for details. maxMagnitude in units s^order / m.
problem.motionCompensation.order = [1, 2];
problem.motionCompensation.maxMagnitude = [0, 1e-4];

% Make a new optimizationProblem object using the updated specifications.
% This explicit call is necessary to update all private variables.
